The bunagaya may look like children, but while Seiganese individuals of other races will grow old and grey, bunagaya keep their youthful features and thick orange hair well into their later years. The bunagaya are coastal folk and gladly put this knowledge to good use by helping fisherfolk with their trade; with a bunagaya companion, you can always guarantee returning home with a bucketful of fish.",
                            "Bunagaya reside in the banyan trees of Shikahanshotō, creating complex networks of treehouses and hanging walkways. When away from home, most bunagaya are fairly restless until they can find an elevated position on which to sleep.",
                            "Another such peculiarity is the shared enmity between bunagaya and octopuses. This antagonism spans back generations and no-one can quite remember why it is that they dislike each other so much."
